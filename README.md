## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This project serves as an experimental exercise in leveraging AI code generation tools to rapidly prototype and iterate on new ideas. The development process utilized:

- **Claude AI** - For generating initial component structures and game logic
- **GitHub Copilot** - For real-time code suggestions and completions
- **Cursor IDE** - For AI-powered code editing and refactoring

The AI-assisted approach allowed for:

- Rapid prototyping of game mechanics
- Quick iteration on UI/UX designs
- Efficient problem-solving for complex game logic
- Consistent code style and patterns across components

This experimental approach demonstrated how AI tools can significantly accelerate the development process while maintaining code quality and architectural consistency. The human developer's role focused on:

- High-level architecture decisions
- Game design and user experience
- Code review and quality assurance
- Performance optimization
- Feature prioritization

## üì± Features

- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Clean, modern UI with consistent styling across games
- Progress tracking and statistics for each game
- Helpful tutorials and "How to Play" guides
- Keyboard support for all games
- Dark mode support
